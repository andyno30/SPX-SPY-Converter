            <p>In order to trade SPX options efficiently, it is important to easily convert SPX price to SPY price level as SPX chart lacks volume statistics. It would be convenient if you could just divide the price of SPX by 10. However, that is not the answer since the SPX to SPY ratio fluctuates everyday due to the impact of interest rates and dividends of various tickers. It is obvious that a price conversion tool is needed, therefore, spyconverter.com was created to convert the price of SPX-SPY more efficiently.</p>
